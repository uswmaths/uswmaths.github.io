## Location

If you are coming to the USW maths department, take the train to TREFOREST train station. Don't get off at TREFOREST ESTATE as this is a different station. As you pull into the station you will see the university on your left -- it is a 5 minute walk from the station.

The maths department is in J-Block which is at the rear of the campus. A map of the campus is <a href = "https://www.southwales.ac.uk/documents/33/USW_A4_Campus_Map_TREF_NEW.PDF">here</a>, and J-Block (also called Johnstown) is marked as Building 9. We are on the 4th floor.

### Seminars

We normally go for lunch at 12:45pm before seminars. The seminar happens at 2pm, and then we adjourn to the Otley pub for drinks at 4pm. 

Our audience tends to be drawn from a wide array of backgrounds -- across all of mathematics and beyond. PhD students, Masters students and undergraduates often attend our seminars. We tend to appreciate talks that take into account our diverse background.
